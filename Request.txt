Hi there, 
After reading your profile, I am very happy to say that we want to work with you and your skills. I have my dev team for developing Web/mobile projects. Could you become our manager? Please contact me.
Regards.

-----

We want to access the US only jobs on upwork.com.
As the manager of our team, your role is to interview clients. We will do the projects.

Most clients from the US ask for a call, but we can't because of English skills.
It will take about 1 or 2 hours per week.

If we get the job when you have a call with clients, you will get 30% of income.
If we get the job without calling, you will get 20% of income.

------

We are a team at China that working for software development and wanted to take look the United State jobs ourselves.

but there were some troubles between culture and languages.

You know, most clients are looking for a guy who can work on their project with a combined hand-skill with good communication as well as full-stack developer.

If it does make sense, can we make the schedule for the quick call? So that I can explain to you what we are looking for exactly

-- Our scenario looks like.
To apply to US only jobs, we need to send proposals from US account. You are located in the US, so we will send proposals through your account.

For example, 
I will bid for the jobs on your profile. If we get the client's response, I will chat with them by text. If they ask for a call, I will inform you about that. 
Once we finish the project, the money will come to your bank account. You will keep your % and transfer the rest to my paypal account.

if we get the job when you have a call with clients, you will get 30% of income.
If we get the job without calling, you will get 20% of income.
